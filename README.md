# ♔ Chess Engine - Multi-Paradigm Project

A fully functional chess game demonstrating the integration of three programming paradigms: **Logic Programming (Prolog)**, **Functional Programming (Scheme)**, and **Object-Oriented Programming (C++)**.

## 📋 Project Overview

This chess engine showcases how different programming paradigms can work together seamlessly to create a complete application. Each language contributes its strengths:

- **Prolog**: Encodes chess rules, validates moves, and detects check/checkmate using declarative logic
- **C++**: Manages the game engine, board state, and user interface using object-oriented design
- **Scheme**: Implements the AI opponent using functional programming and the minimax algorithm
